# The Various Flavors of Ethereum Developer Tools

## Smart Contract Languages
The most common language is Solidity and it has the majority of the market. Vyper still feels experimental, but it's worth knowing that it exists.
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
- [Vyper](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Development Frameworks
For some reason, a lot of these frameworks seem to enjoy naming themselves after food. Here are some of the more popular ones that are out there:
- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) What seems to be the most popular smart contract development framework. 
- [Brownie](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie-v2) Python based development framework
- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) Typescript based development framework
- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle) Ether.js based development framework

## Tools
Some other tools to be aware of:
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) A Ethereum wallet app in the form of a browser extension
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) A cloudbased IDE with built-in functionality to write and test smart contracts in your browser
- [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) An app in truffle suite of tools to spin up a local test Ethereum blockchain, both in GUI and CLI form 
- [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) A faucet to request test Ether to deploy and test smart contracts on official Ethereum testnets
